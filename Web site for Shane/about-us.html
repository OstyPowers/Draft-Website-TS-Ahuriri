					<h5>Julia Appleby</h5>
					<p>A member of Phi Beta Kappa and the valedictorian of her class at Hunter College, Julia went on to work in the restaurant business before opening Ye Olde Bookshop in 2001. In short time, her interest in and knowledge of history and literature made her a natural to assume the responsibilities of store owner and operatpr, a position she holds to this day. Julia abides by the following, “People say that life is the thing, but I prefer reading.” Her favorite author is Shakespeare with Tempest being her favorite peice of work.</p>

					<h5>Miranda</h5>
					<p>An English major with a magna cum laude degree from Kenyon College, Miranda garnered experience working with children at elementary schools and pre-school summer camps. She moved to Carnegie Hill when she was five years old, where The Corner Bookstore became her favorite place to spend time. She credits the store and the staff for making her the reader she is today. “I have wanted to work here my entire life and give customers (especially the kids!) the literary guidance I consider myself so lucky to have grown up with".</p>
